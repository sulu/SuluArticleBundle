The **SuluArticleBundle** integrates a performance optimized way for managing articles in the [Sulu](https://sulu.io/) 
content management system. In the context of this bundle, **articles are localized content-rich entities** that are 
**manageable via the Sulu administration interface** and can be **rendered on a website delivered by Sulu**. 
This makes them a good choice for managing things like blog posts, products or even recipes in a Sulu project. 
In order to keep things clean, the bundle allows to **manage different types of articles via separated lists** in the 
administration interface.

The SuluArticleBundle is compatible with Sulu **starting from version 2.0**. Have a look at the `require` section in 
the [composer.json](https://github.com/sulu/SuluArticleBundle/blob/2.x/composer.json) to find an 
**up-to-date list of the requirements** of the bundle.


## 🚀&nbsp; Installation and Documentation

Execute the following [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) commands to add the bundle to the dependencies of your 
project:

```bash
composer require "elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.9.*" # should match version of your elasticsearch installation
composer require sulu/article-bundle
```

Afterwards, visit the [bundle documentation](https://github.com/sulu/SuluArticleBundle/blob/2.x/Resources/doc) to 
find out **how to set up and configure the SuluArticleBundle** to your specific needs.


## 💡&nbsp; Key Concepts

### Article Characteristics

Like Sulu pages, articles are **configured via templates** and can include additional **SEO and excerpt information**.
Moreover, articles support the same **drafting, publishing and versioning functionality** as provided by pages.
In contrast to Sulu pages, articles are **managed in a flat list** instead of a tree structure. Furthermore, unlike 
the Sulu page tree, the article bundle is **optimized for managing a big number of articles**.


### Elasticsearch dependency

The SuluArticleBundle was originally developed to be used in the publishing industry. To satisfy the initial 
requirements regarding performance and scalability, a **view layer stored in an Elasticsearch index** was utilized. 
Because of this, there is **no way to use the bundle without Elasticsearch** at the moment. It is planned to
remove this hard dependency in the next major version.

If you cannot or do not want to make Elasticsearch a dependency of your project, you can **use Sulu pages for 
certain use cases** instead of the SuluArticleBundle. However, be aware that the article list provides a better 
performance and is more comfortable to use with a large number of entities.
